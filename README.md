# Bezier_Curves_With_LERP_JS
I've wanted to make this project for a while and after a bit of research and gaining some knowledge about geometry I did it. It uses 3 point bezier curve to make a seaming line without disconnections.
In the future I think of macking a racing game using this as a starting point. :)
